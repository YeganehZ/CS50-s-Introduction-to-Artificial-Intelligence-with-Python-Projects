# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python: Course Projects

This repository contains the projects I have implemented for CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course, offered by Harvard University through edX. This course explores some of the ideas, techniques, and algorithms that are at the foundation of artificial intelligence (e.g., search, neural networks, learning, etc.) with Python.
